WandGrowth (Advanced) Add-on for WandWorkshop2.0 
    (Absorb Stats + Omni Pillar)

CHANGES
=======
Adds "wand growth" feature to the wand workshop (2.0):
  If the sacrifice wand for a stat pillar wouldn't improve the target wand by swapping stats, it has a % of its stats stolen instead.
  The % is based on the mix ratio. If you set it above 100%, anything above 100% is the stolen amount (so 110% => 100% swap + 10% theft if already better)
  If you set the mix ratio to 100 or less, growth is disabled for the stat pillars.
Adds "omni" pillar feature:
  Omni pillar works if the mix_ratio is above 100% or, alternatively, if you set the omni ratio to something other than 0%.
  Omni will *only* absorb stats that can be grown. Whatever your absorb ratio is (mix_ratio - 100), Omni takes half.
  In exchange, Omni works on all absorbable stats simultaneously (that's 6 pillars at once): speed, reload, mana, charge, slots and spread.

CREDITS
=======
I stole this credit blurb from Gladious, creator of the 2.0 version of the mod, which saw Spread and Capacity altars (huge, huge thanks for these).
    All credits to Megacrafter127 the creator of the original mod. Modified version of the Wand Workshop mod. 
    This modified version adds 2 missing altars, the spread altar and the capacity altar.

And so, additional credit to Gladious, for creating the 2.0 version I based my modified version (2.5?) on.
